# Overview of the Project: 
Technology has advanced drastically over the past 20 years and has become an integral part of everyday life. Furthermore, adolescents are often some of the first groups to adopt new technology and use it as a main source of information, entertainment, and communication amongst their peers. Technology use for adolescents may have the potential to impede on their well-being if not used properly. Therefore, the focus of our project is to investigate how adolescents’ use of technology influences their physical health and academic success.  Our research topic stems from data collected through the CDC’s Youth Risk Behaviour Survey (YRBS) which surveys adolescents on various social and health-related behaviour's. 
 
# SMART Questions: 
We are particularly interested in how technology is affecting young people's physical
health and academic progress. So, in order to address it, we are posing the 
questions listed below.
1. How does adolescents’ technology use relate to their physical health and
 academic success between the years of 2009 - 2019?
2. Do adolescents of various races differ in their physical health
and academic success?
 
# Approach of the Project: 
Some of the models we intend to use include a linear regression looking at hours of technology use and BMI as well as a one-way ANOVA looking at differences in average BMI across groups based on their hours of technology use (can make categories based on hours). We can also run a classification model (KNN) to predict grades from hours of technology use. When looking at race, we plan to conduct a one-way ANOVA between different racial groups and their average BMIs and a chi-squared test of independence for race and grades 
 
Our dataset contains over 200,000 responses from surveys conducted between the years 1991-2019. The source of our dataset: https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/data/yrbs/data.htm
